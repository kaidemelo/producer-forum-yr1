    <h2>Introduction</h2> 
    <a>My site is a hobbyist website for a community of producers to share and learn information for music production and for starting an online beat selling business. My website shows information on the best audio workstations and virtual plugins to use, shows recent news and the best headphones to use. It also has a page of videos to help educate or inspire young producers to start there business.</a>
        
    <h2>Background</h2>  
    <a>My websites target audience is young producers, and entrepreneurs. Anyone interested in expanding or learning about not only music production but turning there hobby into a online business. Becuase of how technology has advanced, learning to create music using programs is accesible to everyone and no longer do you need a studio full of expensive equipment, as a laptop is all you need. Because of this my website is here to help educate and show the most popular programs and equipment, and spread awareness of other sucessful internet producers. Some examples of what inspired me to make this website is the Producergrind Podcast, the Internet Money youtube channel, the Producer Spot website and Curtis Kings youtube channel.

    <h2>Planning</h2>    
    <a>The type of structure i decided to implement when building my site is a tree sturcture. My nav bar allows all main pages of the website to be acessed from the top, regardless of the page the user is on. In terms of acessibility, one of the ways i have ensured it for my website is by creating my website in colours that are suitable for all types of colour blindness. I restrained from using certain colour combinations such as red with green, green with yellow, blue with purple, or blue with yellow. I have also made sure to correctly tag all images and videos with the alt tag as this is what screen readers will use when a blind person acesses the website. Another thing i did to ensure accessibility was avoiding the use of any bright flashing lights which may trigger eppilespsy for some people.
    <br>
    I have considered usability by keeping all the images the same size and aspect ratio for ease of viewing, i also used a uniform font and text colour for the same reason. I have decided to make navigation easier by making a overhead navigation bar with links to all the pages. I also have some buttons on the home page which link to the news and videos pages. You can reach any page from any page which is very useful and convenient.</a>

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <a>When making my website I learned how to use css media queries which is used to select cetain css code depending on the users screen size and oreintation, however i didnt fully implement them as far as i cwould have liked to, for example i didnt set different rules for every type of screen size which could have increased the usability across devices such as iphones, tablets and so on. I also learnt to use the css :hover to contol the appearance of buttons when the cursor is over it. For most of the new things I learned whilst making this website was through watching youtube tutorials and by reading online. I also learned to embed youtube videos into my website for the video page I created where users can view helpful tutorial and podcasts to help them with their business. I didnt use any tutorials to learn to embed I just went on the share section of the youtube video and selected and copied the code to embed the video. 
    <br>
    For my site reseources I mainly used the W3C schools, and youtube tutorials.</a>   
    
    <h2>Evaluation</h2>   
    <a>In regards to what I beleive went well, I think that I have implemented well suited css for laptop browsing which spreads my website out well for ease of viewing and ease of use, whilst remaining simple and easy to navigate throughout the different pages using the navbar located at the top of the page. The navbar is another thing I believe worked well. The navbar logo with a hyperlink also worked well. In addition the homepage buttons worked well by implementing responsive css. The embedded video page and also the slightly darkened page background to increase the ease of reading both worked well. By using certain images with no background (.png files) I was able to create quite a nice effect for the news page, as the text and pictures nicely float above the site background, this looks way nicer than if the headphone images had white or black backgrounds. The background image that covers the entire background is a studio which fits nicely with my sites theme, and I deliberately choose a very large image so that the background looks detailed regardless of the screen size.
    <br>
    If I was given more time to improve my website I would definitely implement the use of jquery and javascript to make my site even more responsive, maybe with some login pages, or a forum that users could post to. I would also implement media queries further so that for every type of screen/device my webiste is easy to read and accessible. As on mobile my nav bar and videos page are not as good as they could be as the nav bar is on two lines depending on the screen size, and the videos overlap depending on he device. I would have to set css individually for each screen size through various testing and trial and error methods. I believe if there was a working forum, login page, and page transitions to make the site look smoother, my website would be way closer to some of the successful hobbyist producer websites.
    <br>
    I looked into some of the ways I could implement this but knew I didnt have enough time. If I was to implemnt the login I would use ajax for client server control and jquery for validating login details. For this I would also have to use mysql for the database part of users login details. I would certainly implement jquery for a more interactive design.</a>
